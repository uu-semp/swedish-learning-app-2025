# 🏷️ Swedish Learning App – Dressing Pelle

A web-based application that helps users learn basic Swedish words and pronunciation through interactive exercises.

## 💡 Overview / Introduction

This project is an interactive Swedish language-learning game designed to make vocabulary acquisition engaging and effective through playful, avatar-based activities. The main goal of the system is to help players progressively build their Swedish language skills in a structured, game-like environment. In the game, players assist the avatar Pelle by dressing him in different clothing items according to Swedish descriptions, reinforcing vocabulary through visual and interactive learning. The game features three progressive levels, each introducing more complex linguistic challenges. To enhance learning outcomes, the system provides structured feedback, including immediate error detection and end-of-level performance summaries, allowing players to monitor their progress and improve over time.
