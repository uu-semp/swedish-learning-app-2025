- decide to avoid drag and drop thing and doing just a click and appear
thing to be upgraded later on and have a minimum working software

it to a DB .... for now... 

- The game logic chack if an answer is correct bypassing the target area, simply 
reordering the player list of clother and the right ansert list so the comparsion is easier
