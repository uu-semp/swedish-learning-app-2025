## ✨ Features

- **Audio-to-image matching**: Listen to Swedish words and select the correct picture.
- **Category-based learning**: Choose topics (e.g., food, transport, animals) to customize your session.
- **Progress tracking**: Review correct/incorrect answers on the end screen.
- **Fully accessible**: Supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Offline-ready**: Uses local storage for session data.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Welcome Page** – Quick tutorial for first-time users.
2. **Category Selection** – Pick a vocabulary theme.
3. **Gameplay** – Hear a word, choose the matching image from 4 options.
4. **Results Screen** – See your score and review mistakes.

### ⚒️ Architecture

The app is organized into self-contained component directories, enabling clear separation of concerns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** + **CSS3** (responsive, semantic markup)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+ modules via script organization)
- **Font Awesome** (version 6 for icon and button styling)
- **Web Audio API** for pronunciation playback
- **localStorage** (no additiona storage is used.)
- No build tools — runs directly in the browser!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Starting Game

For detailed instructions, check the external [README](../README.md).

_Alternatively_

Install extension `Live Server` in VSCODE and with it open the [external root](../index.html).

### Playing Game

Play through the flow: Main Menu → Select the game with our logo → Welcome → Select Category → Play → Review Results.

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Current Approach**

Current testing is conducted through an HTML test page in the selection component:

- Enable specific test scripts (e.g.,

  - `store/store.tests.js`→ unit tests for data operations,

  - `selection/SelectionTest.html` → `selection_system_test`)

- Manual testing done by openning the HTML files for each component.
- **Future Improvement**: Migrate to JEST framework for enhanced testing capabilities

### Test Coverage

- ✅**Unit Tests**: Individual function testing for store component
- ✅**Integration Tests**: Cross-function testing within store operations
- ✅**System Tests**: Comprehensive testing of selection component functionality

**Future Needs**: Stress tests (large word sets) and security checks (input validation)

## 🤝 Contributing

### Guidelines

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Architecture Compliance**: Follow the established project architecture, keep logic in selection/, UI in main_game/, etc.

`📌 Refer to the D3 hand-in document for detailed architectural rules. `

2. **Licensing**: Ensure all images have traceable licensing information or created by maintainers.
3. **Accessibility**: Maintain keyboard navigation support throughout the application
4. **User Experience**: Prioritize accessible design patterns and consistent visual feedback and design theme.

**Code Quality**

- Refactor JavaScript into small, reusable functions.
- Avoid global variables; use clear module boundaries.
- Comment complex logic (e.g., randomization algorithms).
